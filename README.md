## Instructor: [Sue Smith][instructor url]


Virtual reality (VR) is an exhiting technology that promises new vistas of immersive experience. With the Google Cardboard SDK for Android, developing VR content for Cardboard has become much easier. Cardboard viewers are now readily available, with a host of apps already offering VR interaction. 

In this short course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Sue Smith will show you how to set up the development environment for Cardboard on Android using Android Studio. You'll see how to get the Cardboard SDK for Android starter project up and running. Then, by exploring and hacking the sample code, you'll learn the essentials in Cardboard development, including OpenGL shape modeling and interaction through the Cardboard viewer. You'll see how to edit the graphics code and respond to a user looking at an object or pressing the trigger. 


## Source Files Description


The source code is a fork of the original Google sample project for Cardboard. Throughout the course we explore and edit various parts of the sample, particularly the shape code in the `WorldLayoutData.java` class and the `MainActivity.java` class. Our changes to the "Treasure Hunt" app alter the colors, shapes and user interaction when the user looks at the cube object and when they pull the trigger in the Cardboard viewer.
